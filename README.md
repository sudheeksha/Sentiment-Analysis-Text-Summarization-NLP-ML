## Web Scraping

- Chrome web driver is OS dependent.
- Selenium is a framework for testing web apps, in this project selenium is used to automate the process of retreiving all reviews for a specified movie.
- movie_urls.txt contains links to the IMDb review page, if additional movies reviews are required the corresponding links can be added to the text file. This is processed by reviews_analysis.py
- reviews_analysis.py contains only one function, upon running this script the following steps take place:
- Selenium starts a chrome browser and loads the specified URL.
- The loop continues to scroll through the webpage until "load-more" button is encountered.
- BeautifulSoup is then intialized which scrapes the data from the HTML page.
- These reviews are stored in a json file, the key represents movie name and the value contains a list of reviews.

## Generating a word cloud
- To generate a word cloud run the python script generating_word_cloud.py
- It combines the reviews of all the movies and passes it as a parameter to the word cloud.
- In this, words vary between font size and color 

## Sentiment Analysis
1. Ensure all the libraries below are installed
2. imbd_test.txt and imbd_train.txt are in the same directory as this python file.
3. Enter the file name of movie data file at prompt.
4. Ensure that movie data file is in same directory as this python file.
5. When prompted enter  '1' for logistic regression
                        '2' for svm
                        '3' for naive bayes
                        anything else for termination


## Text Summarization

### TextRank Algorithm 


### Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency

#### Running the code

- movie.txt is a text file which contains review of one movie
- This file is required for tf_idf_text_summary.py to execute
- The data from the text file is read and cleaned using the method ```def eliminate_url_emoji(string)```
- In the next step, a sent_tokenizer is used to convert a string into a list of tokens
- A word frequency matrix is computed using ```eliminate_stopwords_stemming(sentences)```
- Followed by term frequency, inverse document frequency, and a tf-idf matrix.
- Sentences are scored, average score is obtained and is multiplied by a threshold value to generate a summary of reviews.
- The length of a summary is inversely proportional to the threshold value.
